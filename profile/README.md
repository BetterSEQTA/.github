# BetterSEQTA+

Aiming to become the #1 improved SEQTA browser extension. Currently consisting of 4 repos:

1. [`BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Plus`](https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Plus) - The main chrome extension
2. [`BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Themes`](https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Themes) - The repo consisting of all themes available from the store page and downloadable backgrounds
3. [`BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Discord-Bot`](https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/BetterSEQTA-Discord-Bot) - A discord bot aiming to make commmunity theme submissions simpler
4. [`BetterSEQTA/DesQTA`](https://github.com/BetterSEQTA/DesQTA) - A desktop-first implementation of a specially designed SEQTA client made in Tauri with Svelte and Rust to make SEQTA fast, pretty, and efficient, all on your computer.

Currently, our main focus is on TauriSEQTA as our latest project, but BetterSEQTA+ is also actively maintained. Other repos are complementary to these main two repos.
